<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Hello! It seems you've made it onto my art page. I'm a queer black artist that specializes in coding, illustration and animation. I have spent years developing my skill and style in a myriad of programs including Clipstudio Art, Photoshop and Blender.</h3>
<h3>Although my love for coding is recent, I'm excited to find new ways to incorporate it into my love of comics and storytelling. </h3>
